DICOS Usage in the Security Screening Workflow</h1>
<p>The following image illustrates how the DICOS file specification fits into the Security Screening Workflow. At points in the Security Workflow where data about an Object Of Inspection needs to be transferred from one device to another DICOS file Specification is used to format the data for sending and the DICOS Networking Protocol is used to send and receive the data.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p class="startli">Objects of Inspection (OOI) such as baggage, cargo, people etc., are passed through security screening devices. These include EDS, DX and AIT devices.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">Security devices output DICOS files with the screening data such as CT Volume, time and location of scan, etc. that are sent over a network to other devices for further processing. Security scanning devices may or may not generate a Threat Detection Report (TDR) for the OOI.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">The DICOS Transfer protocol is used to transfer these files over a network to other DICOS compatible devices. These follow on devices include <b>Automated Threat Recognition (ATR)</b> devices and <b>On Screen Resolution (OSR)</b> Devices.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">Follow on Security Devices can make an <b>Alarm Decision</b> about the object being inspected or forward it on for further processing As an example, an ATR device may not be able to make a definitive decision about an OOI and so it will be forwarded to an OSR device for further inspection by security personnel.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
DICOS files can be stored in a database for further processing, future analysis, training etc. </li>
