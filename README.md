## Motivations

This project was initiated to enable the usage of DICOS data in machine learning workflows. 
PyDICOS is intended to be a simple python wrapper of Stratovan's C++ [DICOS library](https://www.stratovan.com/products/dicos-toolkit).
Note that this is **NOT** an open source implementation of the DICOS standard.

PyDICOS relies on [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) to wrap DICOS user-level API to python.
It depends on numpy to load data in python and can easily be installed _via_ `pip`.

PyDICOS is unrelated to [pydicom](https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom) in its implementation and contributors, 
while being similar in its core spirit (enabling python data manipulations).

## Open Architecture

We firmly believe that by releasing this library, we will encourage and support the [Open Architecture framework](https://www.aci-europe.org/downloads/resources/TSA-230504-7_4.1%20Attachment%201%20OA%20for%20Airport%20Security%20Systems%202nd%20Edition%20%20FINAL.pdf). We welcome all actors of airport security to review and use this library.

## Scope

 - Provide a pythonized API for the DICOS toolkit
   - [x] First release : read/write functions for CT, DX and TDR, user-level API
   - [x] First releases : DICOS protocol, client/server functions
   - [ ] Future release : more pure python functions to shave off heavy cpp signatures 
   - [ ] Future release : library indexed in Pypi 
   - [ ] Out of scope for now : Windows release
   - [ ] Out of scope for now : AIT2D, AIT3D, QR
   - [ ] Out of scope for now : Module and Tag level APIs
 - Stay up to date with Stratovan latest releases
   - Currently tested and supported DICOS version : `v3`

## Install

### Building from source

To setup the build environment, run the following command to install required dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install the [Stratovan toolkit](https://www.stratovan.com/products/dicos-toolkit) in the `opt` folder.
```
chmod +x ./sdicos_lin_ubuntu-20-{version}.run
./sdicos_lin_ubuntu-20-{version}.run --unattendedmodeui none --mode unattended --prefix /opt/stratovan/sdicos
```

To generate a python wheel :

```
python setup.py bdist_wheel
```

The lib wheel should be produced in the `dist` folder and can be installed _via_ `pip`.

### ðŸš§ Using Pypi index ðŸš§

Using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) directly from Pypi index :
```
pip install pydicos
```
This install method has not been released yet.

## Usage

### Script usage

Refer to our [exemple files](https://github.com/Auxilia-tech/pyDICOS/tests) to explore the binded methods.
The stratovan exemple files were entirely translated in python.

Here is a quick exemple for a script that reads a CT and a DX scan.

``` python
from pydicos import CTLoader, DXLoader

ct_object = CTLoader(filename="SimpleCT/SimpleCT.dcs")
data = ct_object.get_data() # 3-dimentionnal numpy array

dx_object = DXLoader(filename="DXFiles/SimpleDX.dcs")
data = dx_object.get_data() # 2-dimentionnal numpy array
```

More complex operations can be addressed by using the C++ functions directly. 
They can be invoked using the `pyDICOS` modules. For example, the previous 
script would look like this :

``` python
from pyDICOS import CT, DX, ErrorLog, Filename
   
ct, err, file = CT(), ErrorLog(), Filename("SimpleCT/SimpleCT.dcs")
if not ct.Read(file, err, None):
   raise RuntimeError(f"Failed to read DICOS file: {filename}\n{_err.GetErrorLog().Get()}")
data = ... # This is very long, refer to pydicos._loaders::CTLoader.get_data for full script

dx, err, file = DX(), ErrorLog(), Filename("SimpleCT/SimpleCT.dcs")
if not dx.Read(file, err, None):
   raise RuntimeError(f"Failed to read DICOS file: {filename}\n{_err.GetErrorLog().Get()}")
data = np.array(dx.GetXRayData().GetUnsigned16(), copy=False)
```
As you can see, `pyDICOS` is the direct translation of the C++ classes and methods signatures.
More classes and functions examples are available in the `tests` folder.
