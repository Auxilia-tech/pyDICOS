          ConnectFailReason: Timeout
          A few possible causes for a connection timeout are:
          - The remote host is not reachable (perhaps a firewall is blocking the connection on the remote end).
          - Your ISP is blocking the outbound connection (this is common for SMTP port 25).
          - If your timeout is too short, then maybe the server is just too slow to accept the connection.
